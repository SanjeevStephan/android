Before using the Android Youtube API, you need to register your application, including your digitally signed .apk file’s public certificate in the Google Developers Console. To register the application, follow these steps.

1.Go to the Google Developers Console <br/>
2.Create a new project. I named mine VideoTube. <br/>
3.In the sidebar on the left, make sure that Library is selected. On the right panel, select the Youtube Data API and Enable it on the page that follows. <br/>
4.In the sidebar on the left, select Credentials. For credentials, the API supports OAuth 2.0, the use of an API key and of a Service account. We’ll use the API key option. <br/>
5.Select API key from the Create Credentials dropdown menu. A popup will appear with the value of your API key. Keep this window open, we’ll use the key in the next step. <br/>
