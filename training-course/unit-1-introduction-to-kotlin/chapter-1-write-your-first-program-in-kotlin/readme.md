# Write your first program in Kotlin

## 1. Before you begin

In this chapter, you are going to write your first program in the Kotlin language using an interactive editor that you can run from your browser.

You can think of a program as a series of instructions for the system to perform some action. For example, you could write a program that creates a birthday card. In that program, you could write an instruction to print congratulatory text or calculate someone's age from their birth year.

Just like you use human language to communicate with another person, you use a programming language to communicate with the operating system of your computer. Fortunately, programming languages are less complex than human languages and quite logical!

Android apps are written in the Kotlin programming language. Kotlin is a modern language created to help developers write code efficiently and with as few errors as possible.

Learning to create an app and learning the basics of programming at the same time will be challenging, so we are going to start you off with a bit of programming before getting into app creation. Becoming comfortable with some programming basics first is not only an important step towards creating apps, it is also going to make it easier to create your first app later in this course.

Code editors are tools that help you write code, in the same way a word processor (like Google Docs) helps you create text documents. In this codelab, you are using an interactive Kotlin editor within your browser. This means that you do not have to install any software to take your first step towards app development.
